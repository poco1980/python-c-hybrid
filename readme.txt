IronPython is an open-source implement of the Python programming language 
which is tightly integrated with the .NET Framework. 

IronPython can use the .NET Framework and Python libraries, and other .NET 
languages can use Python code just as easily.

There's also PythonNet. Python for .NET is a package that gives all Python 
programmers nearly seamless integration with the .NET Common Language Runtime
(CLR) and provides a powerful application scripting tool for .NET developers.
PythonNet which has similar goals as IronPython but is a different solution.
